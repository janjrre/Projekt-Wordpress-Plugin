# W0/O03 – OrgaVela OpenPGP/PGPony migration ADR (2026-10-20)

**Decision: APPROVED for future OrgaVela backup design, NOT live deployment.** The owner explicitly chose PGPony/OpenPGP instead of AgePony/age and requested a read-only comparison with the independently operated Dreamloud backup system. This ADR supersedes the **future encryption-format choice** in [GH03 age ADR](W0_O03_GH03_ENCRYPTION_RECOVERY_ADR.md) without rewriting that historical document. The master V1 acceptance plan and \`V1_PROGRESS.json\` remain canonical for acceptance and counts.

## Architecture decision / Dreamloud factual baseline

Read-only reference: private GitHub repo \`janjrre/dreamloud-portal\`, branch \`backup/production-circleci\`; no Dreamloud modifications or credentials reused.

- \`scripts/pack-encrypted-backup.sh\`: isolated GNUPGHOME, exact public OpenPGP **primary fingerprint** validation, deny accidental secret-key import; internal manifest with original compressed MariaDB/WordPress hashes encrypted with the archive; public sanitized manifest, encrypted \`.tar.gpg\` and \`.sha256\` sidecar.
- \`.circleci/config.yml\`: bounded source capture and ciphertext-only writer use **different restricted contexts**; manual opt-in / protected branch for production backups. Operational job IDs and security scopes are Dreamloud-specific, not OrgaVela tests.
- \`scripts/verify-offsite-backup.sh\`, \`scripts/run-isolated-full-restore.sh\`: verify ciphertext, OpenPGP recipient match and archive integrity; isolated restore checks the database and WordPress behavior in its own test environment.
- \`.github/backup/README.md\`: production and historical recipient fingerprints must be versioned and never conflated; historic ciphertext can remain unreadable after rotation if the corresponding old private key is lost. Source/writer contexts never get the permanent owner private key.

## Binding OrgaVela decision

1. **PGPony handles owner-controlled OpenPGP private recovery material; headless CI uses GnuPG and a verified exported PUBLIC key only.** PGPony iOS secret-key export/import format and exact GnuPG algorithm support require a real owner-only *synthetic* cross-tool interoperability test. Do not assume every OpenPGP v6/PQ mode works with installed CI GnuPG. Choose a widely compatible key plus encryption-capable subkey only after verifying support.
2. Separate keypair and policy for **OrgaVela only**. Never reuse Dreamloud fingerprint, key, identity, public policy, contexts, backup repo or tokens. Never import the owner's personal secret key to the GitHub source repo, CircleCI source/writer contexts, IONOS, WordPress or ChatGPT.
3. Proposed production backup file trio: \`orgavela-*.tar.gpg\`, \`orgavela-*.tar.gpg.sha256\`, \`manifest.json\` (public **sanitized**). An **encrypted internal manifest** shall identify source component digests, capture consistency, product/schema version and key fingerprint. The publicly visible manifest cannot include DB credentials, configuration, private filenames or row content.
4. Future two-job design: OrgaVela source reads only its own IONOS WordPress/MariaDB instance via scoped credentials, securely produces a consistent dump and filesystem snapshot, validates them, and encrypts **before** handing a ciphertext-only workspace to the private GitHub Release writer. Writer accesses **only** \`janjrre/orgavela-backups\` via a separate restricted short-lived token/context. No plaintext in CI persisted artifacts or public logs. A single release must be \`immutable=true\` with binary SHA-256 readback before and after publication.
5. Recovery uses **separate** restricted/manual process and independent owner-held PGPony exported private key. Verify fingerprint matches archived public policy, decrypted hashes, database import, media/config, isolated WordPress boot and core critical OrgaVela tables/portal without contacting production mail/cron/external systems. Restore test and staging access must be validated for the exact release source.
6. No automatic cron, real backup capture, owner-key upload, token creation, PR merge or production modification as part of this ADR. Prior synthetic GH-04 GPG and GH-06 age test **remain true historical results**; age results do not prove new owner-PGPony-key restoration or OpenPGP production readiness.
7. Preserve existing AgePony identity, original PDF and one physical printed backup in the safe until a **new PGPony backup format** has passed all recovery and rotation gates. Old \`.tar.age\` synthetic releases are retained as labeled historical fixtures, not silently converted to GPG.

## GH03 owner-key prerequisites

- Operator creates new **exportable** PGPony OpenPGP identity in an owner-controlled safe environment and selects a GnuPG-compatible encryption algorithm/subkey. Only **public** .asc key and its independently confirmed full primary fingerprint may later enter OrgaVela repo after review.
- Two protected, independent offline physical copies of owner-exported PRIVATE recovery key. Verify import without original app/phone, same full fingerprint, encrypt a **synthetic** fixture using PUBLIC key and decrypt using an independently restored private copy; compare SHA-256. Passphrase recovery separate and available after phone loss. Never send secret key, passphrase, private QR or paper-backup photos to chat.
- Rehearse key loss/rotation; keep historic keys for their corresponding encrypted releases. No assumption that current AgePony paper backup can decrypt PGPony/OpenPGP ciphertext.

## Staged implementation and gates (do not inflate 71 M-package counts)

- **PGP-01:** PGPony/GnuPG interoperability and owner copy-2 restore demonstrated **privately**; GH03 new OpenPGP owner acceptance only then.
- **PGP-02:** Synthetic-only offline OpenPGP package+manifest, wrong-fingerprint/secret-input refusal and separate decrypt proof; no cloud credentials.
- **PGP-03:** Integration of source/writer authorization boundaries in isolated default-OFF branch workflow; unit and security CI at exact SHA.
- **PGP-04:** One explicitly authorized **synthetic** private immutable GitHub Release transport plus full remote readbacks and independent GPG decrypt; revoke temporary PAT after.
- **GH05-08 productive:** real consistent source capture, encrypted immutable release, independent full IONOS/WordPress restore, then operational scheduling and monitoring. These remain BLOCKED until GH03/PGP gates and all applicable V1 R gates.
- **Rollback:** no format flipping for historical releases. If migration test fails, keep age reference and historical evidence intact, do not start real backups, revise ADR before another key type.

**Evidence level today:** Dreamloud **source code** reviewed; GH-04 previously passed GPG with disposable test key, but no owner PGPony key has been created/tested. GH-03 OpenPGP acceptance: 0 confirmed physical copies, 0 owner independent restore. V1 Coding 62/71 historical, formal M0–M7 0/8, P4 0/4, R01–R18 0/18.
